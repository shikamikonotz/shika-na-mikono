# TeX Live ISO Distribution Tree #
LaTeX is difficult to obtain here in Africa because it is so large, and it's often difficult to find versions small enough that they can be easily downloaded at the Internet cafe. The smaller versions also commonly lack certain packages that we use for our manuals (in particular, `mhchem`).

Because of this, we are now maintaining a list of people who have the TeX Live .iso file. That way people who want it can find someone close to them who has it and get it. Our goal is to have at least one person in each active region of Tanzania with the ISO.

Here is the most up-to-date list of volunteers who have TeX Live:
  * [David Berg](mailto:dberg918@gmail.com), Mtwara Region
  * [Steve Bonomo](mailto:sbonomo3@gmail.com), Ruvuma Region
  * [Belle Archaphorn](mailto:belledundi@gmail.com), Mbeya Region
  * [Willie Blackmon](mailto:willieblackmon@gmail.com), Mbeya Region
