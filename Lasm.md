# LASM - Locally Available Science Materials #

This project not only contains the _Shika na Mikono_ manual and its country-specific derivatives, but also a collection of teacher's guides that were spawned in March of 2011 with the help of Tanzania's Ministry of Education. They have since become known as the LASM manuals (pronounced **Lazz**-im), because their focus is on using Locally Available Science Materials.

The ideas and activities within these guides come from the great minds of Tanzania's own science teachers, scattered across the entire country, and they were put together and edited by a small group of Peace Corps Volunteers that oversaw the writing process.

The LASM manuals have officially been published by the Ministry! We are all extremely proud of the efforts put forth by everyone involved, and we truly hope that those who receive the guides and use them will be enlightened, inspired, and motivated to improve not only their own teaching methods, but to share the resource with their fellow teachers. We also welcome their help in extending the content of the guides as new ideas come about, as well as fixing any mistakes we may have overlooked.


## How to get the LASM teacher guides ##

Even if you don't receive a published copy of the LASM manuals, you can get a soft copy in PDF format right from this website! Head to the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/shika-na-mikono/downloads/list) section to grab the newest editions.

If you are more technically inclined and have some experience with version control and LaTeX, you are more than welcome to get a copy from our Mercurial repositories and compile your own PDF. Here are the URLs you'll need to make a clone:

For the Biology LASM manual:
> https://code.google.com/p/shika-na-mikono.lasm-bio/

For the Chemistry LASM manual:
> https://code.google.com/p/shika-na-mikono.lasm-chem/

For the Physics LASM manual:
> https://code.google.com/p/shika-na-mikono.lasm-phys/

Compiling is done from the lasm-(subj).tex file; simply open it in your LaTeX editor and hit compile to generate the PDF.
