The Shika Project is a vision to bring hands-on science education to everyone. Our philosophy is that science can be done without the need for expensive equipment, large school budgets, or even a designated school laboratory. Everyone can do it, and the materials are available everywhere.

_Shika na Mikono_ is our Teacher's Manual, designed to help teachers set up low-cost laboratories, find materials to stock it, and give them ideas for experiments that can be performed easily and safely.

We will be uploading compiled PDFs to the Downloads section periodically, but if you'd like to see the current state, you can download the LaTeX code using Mercurial (see the Source section).

Want to help us proof-read, or do you have ideas you'd like to add? Go to our [Instructions](Instructions.md) wiki to learn how to get started!
