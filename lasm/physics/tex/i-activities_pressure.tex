\subsection{Automatic Flushing Tank}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To identify the application of pressure differences}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
The effect of pressure in a liquid can be observed in different ways.  Automatic flushing tanks operate under the influence of pressure in a liquid.  When water fills a container at the level of an outlet, the water continues flowing until it reaches the end of the pipe, at which point it stops flowing out of the container.  As more water is added to the container, water continues to flow again and the cycle continues.  This type of system is useful for flushing or when you need a certain amount of water for a given amount of time.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Empty drinking water bottle, straw, chewing gum, water, and a  bucket  

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Cut off the top of an empty water bottle, make a hole at the bottom so as to fit the straw through it.  
Bend the straw inside the bottle so that it makes an upside down 'U' shape. Use the chewing gum to seal the hole.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Hold the bottle and place the bucket below the bottle.} 
\item{Pour some water into the bottle upto and above the bend in the straw and observe what happens.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
The water will flow into the bucket through the bended straw. 

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Will the water flow from the bottle into the bucket? Why?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The siphon principle states that liquid is able to flow without pumping because the combined pressure of the water and the atmosphere pushing down on the water is greater then the air pushing up on the straw. The automatic flushing tank does not require a handle to trigger the flush. Once the water flows into the tank up to the level of the siphon, the tank will flush automatically.  


\subsection{Cartesian Diver}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To observe characteristics of a submerging body}
\item{To describe and apply the concept of Catersian diver in daily life}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
When the body is immersed in a liquid it may sink or float. The body will float in water when its density is less than density of water. A submerging body is designed in such a way that it will sink a little but also float in water.  

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Large Bottle (1.  5 litres) or transparent long container with a cover or cap, water, syringe, and small stones

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Remove the needles from the syringes.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Fill a bottle with some water.}
\item{Take a few stones and insert them into the syringe.}
\item{Hold the syringe upright and immerse it in the bottle making sure that the syringe and its contents float upright in the water.}
\item{Tighten the bottle cap.}
\item{Gently squeeze the bottle near the bottom.} 
\item{Observe what happens.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
When the bottle is gently squeezed the syringe sinks down to the bottom. When the bottle is released the syringe rises back up.  

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why does the syringe move down when the bottle is squeezed?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
It should be noted that syringe sinks down because the pressure in the bottle increases when you squeeze it and this effectively increases the weight of the syringe. The water in the bottle will find a way to escape and finally enter into the syringe through the needle hole. When the pressure is released, the water in the syringe leaves and so the syringe will float again.  A cartesian diver and a submarine use the same principle to sink and float in deep water.


\subsection{A Siphon}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To demonstrate how to shift water from one bucket to another bucket using suction} 
\item{To identify the applications of atmospheric pressure} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Two buckets, water, thick rubber tube (siphon) about 1 m long

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Pour some water into a bucket and place it on the table. Place the other bucket below the table.} 
\item{Put some water into the siphon and bend the other end so that the water cannot pass.} 
\item{Place the bent end in the lower bucket and the other end of the tube into the water in the bucket on the table. Observe what happens.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
Water will flow from the bucket on the table to the other bucket below the table. The reason for this is that the pressure in the lower end of the tube is lower than the pressure in the bucket on the table. The water will move from the higher pressure to the lower pressure, or from the upper bucket through the siphon to the lower bucket.  

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Will the water flow from the bucket on the table or not? Why?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The water rises into the tube because it is pushed by atmospheric pressure from above. Atmospheric pressure acts on both ends of the tube, but one end has a greater weight of water. Gravity draws the water through that end and maintains the low pressure established before. The tube will pull the water out until the level in the upper bucket falls below the tube.  

\subsection{Liquid Pressure and Depth}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To verify the variation of pressure with depth in water} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
The wall of a dam is made much thicker at the bottom than at the top.  Also, water storage tanks are placed at the top of a building.  This is because the pressure in a liquid is related to its depth.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Plastic bottle, nail or sewing needle, matches, water


\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Light a match and heat the sharp point of the nail or pin.} 
\item{Use the heated nail to put three holes into a bottle. Put one hole near the bottom, one near the middle, and the last hole between them.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Fill the bottle with water up to the rim.} 
\item{Suspend the bottle in air using your hand or place the bottle at the top of a tall object like a stool on a table.} 
\item{Allow water to flow out of the bottle and observe the trajectory from each hole.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
The water flows faster from the hole with the greater depth because there is greater pressure, showing that the water pressure increases with the depth of the water. This is because the weight of the water on top acts downward causing pressure. The greater the depth, the greater the weight, resulting in greater pressure.  

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.  } 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What have you observed in the trajectory of water from each hole?}
\item{How does the pressure change with the depth of water? Why?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
There is a difference between depth and height. Height is measured from the reference point upward while depth is measured from the reference point downward. The reference point in this case is at the surface of water. The holes must not be in the same vertical line in order to view the flow clearly.  

\subsection{Making a Magdeburg Hemisphere}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To explain the effect of atmospheric pressure} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
When air is heated it expands and moves upward.  This will cause the density, or the number of molecules in a given volume, to decrease.  This deficiency of air causes a decrease in pressure in the space where the air was heated, and higher pressure outside causes more air to push in.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Two small cooking pots of equal size, oil, matches, small pieces of paper

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Spread oil or grease around the edge of one of the cooking pots.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Place some pieces of paper in the cooking pot which doesn't have any oil.} 
\item{Light the pieces of paper.} 
\item{Allow the paper to burn until about half of it is burned.} 
\item{Place the greased cooking pot upside-down on top of the ungreased cooking pot so that they create a sort of ball and no air can escape.} 
\item{Allow the pots to cool.} 
\item{Try to separate the pots.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
After the pots cool it is very difficult to separate them. This is because, when you burn the paper, the air in the pot expands and escapes. When you cover the pots, no more air can enter and the air inside cools, reducing the pressure inside the pots while the pressure outside the pots remains the same. The atmospheric pressure therefore presses the pots together so as to equalize the pressure on either side of the pot.  

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{What is the reason for burning the paper and then covering the pot?}
\item{What happens when the pots cool?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
The principle behind the Magdeburg hemisphere is used to create suction. When air is heated, it expands and escapes, causing lower pressure as it cools inside. This means that there are fewer air molecules inside than outside. 

\subsection{Air Pressure Strength}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To observe the effects of air pressure on a flexible material}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
Air in a container pushes out with equal force on all sides of the container.  If the pressure in the container is low, the force is small; if the pressure is high, the force is large.  If the pressure is high, it is difficult to bend or crush the container as the air pressure inside resists being pushed.  If the pressure is high enough, it can cause a flexible container to be rigid.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
plastic straw, potato

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Hold a straw and push it hard into the potato.}
\item{Observe what happens to the straw.}
\item{Place your thumb firmly over one end of a straw and push the other end into the potato.}
\item{Observe what happens to the straw and potato.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Cleanup Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Dispose of the potato and return the straw to its proper place.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Why does the straw not pierce the potato when your thumb is not blocking the back of the straw?}
\item{Why does the straw pierce the potato when your thumb is blocking the potato?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
When the straw is pushed into the potato, it bends.  The skin of the potato is strong enough that the straw cannot pass through it.  However, when your thumb covers the back of the straw, the straw breaks the skin of the potato and passes through.  This is because the air in the straw pushes out against the sides of the straw.  Without your thumb, the air can simply escape out the back of the straw without applying a force.  When your thumb covers the hole, the air cannot go anywhere so it applies a force outward.  This causes the side of the straw to become rigid, allowing it to break the skin of the potato.

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Be sure that, in the first step, you are not holding your thumb over the back of the straw.  This should only be done later.

\subsection{Presence of Pressure in Solids}

\subsubsection*{Learning Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item{To demonstrate the concept of pressure}
\item{To observe the factors affecting pressure} 
\item{To observe the effects of pressure on a solid} 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Background Information}
When a force acts on an object, the results are greatly affected by the area over which it acts.  Consider the pain in your hand or on your head when you carry a bucket of water with thin wire handles.  Wrapping a piece of fabric around the handle or on your head greatly reduces the pain.  This effect may be explained by pressure.

\subsubsection*{Materials}
Bar of soap, thin thread, thick thread, heavy stones

\subsubsection*{Preparation Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all needed materials}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Activity Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Place a bar of soap on the table.} 
\item{Tie stones to the ends of the thick thread. Then tie stones to the end of the thin thread.} 
\item{Hang each type of thread across the bar of soap so that the stones hang freely.} 
\item{Observe the effect of each thread on the bar of soap.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results and Conclusion}
It will be seen that the bar of soap was cut easily by using a thin thread but not by using a thick thread. They should understand that thin thread has a small area and therefore large pressure, while the thick thread has a large area and therefore small pressure.  

\subsubsection*{Clean Up Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Collect all the used materials, cleaning and storing items that will be used later.} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Discussion Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Explain the concept of pressure on a solid.} 
\item{Why does a thin thread cut easily through a bar of soap while a thick thread does not?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Pressure due to solids depends on the weight or force of the solid and its surface area. An object with a large surface area will have a smaller pressure than an object with a small surface area if they have the same weight. For this reason, thin thread applies a greater pressure than thick thread and can therefore cut through soap more easily.
