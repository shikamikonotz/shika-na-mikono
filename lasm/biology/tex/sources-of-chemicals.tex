\chapter{Sources of Chemicals}

The following is a list of chemicals you will need in the biology laboratory. For each we note local sources of these chemicals, low cost industrial sources of
these chemicals, methods to manufacture these chemicals at your school, and/or functional alternatives to these chemicals. We also list information like other names, common uses, and hazards. 
Chemicals are generally listed alphabetically by IUPAC name.
